sidebar: This project was part of a website redesign for AES. To create the outline we gathered data using Analytics, industry-standard tools & techniques to determine competitors search ranking scores and advertising priorities. We were also able to determine primary user groups. We then analyized that data and provided an outline for the content and user flow of the website.

sidebar: A young Alaska Native woman from Emmonak has to pass by her rapist every day. Another woman from the Rosebud Sioux Reservation fears for her life that any day the man who raped her will attack again. Having never been charged for sexually assaulting her, it’s a possibility. While other American women ask what to do if they are raped, 1 out of 3 American Indian women ask themselves what to do when they are raped. In a culture that sustains violence against women, what can lower these life threatening risks? The jurisdiction issues tribal courts face from federal and state governments, seizes power and sovereignty away from reservations. Ending sexual violence will take more than clarifying the law but it’s a start.
